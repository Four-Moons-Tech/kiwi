Portfolio for Anna Moon
This is site is the Portfolio for Anna Moon. It contains 4 sections: About me, My resume, My work and Contact me. 
I used semantic HTML to structure the page and advanced CSS to style it. 
HTML: I used a table with a vertical header to display the main content, a header, a footer and a hero. When the user clicks one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. I laso used a psudo class "hover" for all anchor tags to underline when hovering.
    The table data cell "about" contains Anna Moon's recent picture and a paragraph. When hovering over the picture, it becomer larger. 
    The table data cell "resume" contains an image floated to the right and a list.
    The table data cell "work" contains 2 placeholder images for Anna Moon's recent work, with a titled link and a description.
    The table data cell "contact" contains a list of contacts: phone number, email, a link to LinkedIn and a Link to Github.

I used CSS to create a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
I used flexbox properties to stack the work cards when resizing the page. I used psudo class for hovering. I also used box styling properties to add a radius, shadow a border and a rotation.
